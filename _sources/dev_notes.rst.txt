TPY vs. TMC (1/16/18)
+++++++++++++++++++++
Pytpy no longer uses the .tpy files generated by TwinCAT. As of at least
TwinCAT v3.1.4020 These .tpy files are deprecated and lack important
information such as pragmas. The .tmc files now fulfill this role and contain
the necessary information. Unfortunately, the name 'Pytmc' is already used so
the 'Pytpy' name will remain.
